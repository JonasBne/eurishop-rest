## Purpose

I am building this application during my onboarding at Euricom (solely for educational purposes). The main goal of building the application is to familiarize myself with different tools & techniques in order to deliver a fully operational CRUD application.

## Features

The application consists of three different pages.

In the first version of the application, everything is stored in memory (i.e. all information is lost on a page refresh). Also, at this time the basket api will not be used.

#### Product page for with an overview for the administrator

- This page contains a table that holds information regarding the different products (i.e. name, prize, stock,...);

- The product table can be sortered based on product title, price and stock by clicking on the respective header;

- Initially, all 100 products are shown in the table. There is no pagination at this point;

- The administrator can click a field in the table and then gets redirected to the product detail;

- Products can be added or deleted;

- The product table is not responsive;

- Minimal styling is applied;

#### Product page with an overview for the end user

- This page displays the different products for the end user;

- Page has to be responsive;

- At the righthand side of the page a basket is shown;

- Each product can be added to the basket (if stock is greater than zero);

- There must be a calculation of the total cost for the end user (the sum of the added products to the basket);

- There should be a button that clears the basket;

- There should be a functionality which allows the user to remove certain products from the basket;

- When a product is added that is not in stock, an error must be shown (redirected to an error page)

#### Product page with details

- The product page consists out of a form which displays the detailed information of a given product;

- Products can be modified, added or deleted;

- When adding a new product, title and price are required;
